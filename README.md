# Django Tutorials  
This is a collection of Djanog projects that I have built while learning Django and other useful web technologies, primarily, HTML, Django, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, etc.
  
Following are the short description of each of these Django projects. For more details, please read the README.md file available under each of these projects.
  
## Project_1  
It is a single page application:  
1. Taking input on page "home.html"
2. Printing output on the same page "home.html"  
  
This project is making use of the following technologies:  
1. Django  
2. JavaScript / AJAX / jQuery  
3. CSS  
  
## CelerySample  
This is a sample Celery/Django project.  
  
In this project, we will learn to offload the time-consuming tasks to an asynchronous process which will not hinder the responsiveness of the web application so that user don't feel like stuck.  
  
Following technologies have been used in this project:    
1. Django  
2. CSS  
3. JavaScript / AJAX / jQuery  
4. Celery [KEY ROLE]  
  
## CeleryRPCDemo  
This is a sample Celery/Django project.  
  
In this project, we will learn to offload the time-consuming tasks to an asynchronous process which will not hinder the responsiveness of the web application so that user don't feel like stuck. Along with this, we will keep checking the status of the offloaded task in this project.  
  
Following technologies are the key focus in this project:  
1. Django
2. Celery
3. RPC  
  
## SimpleWebsocket  
This is a simple Djanog project to demonstrate the working of WebSockets in Django.  
In this project, following is accomplished:  
1. On clicking a HTML button, the javascript function will connect with the backend (a Django function) through a web-socket  
2. This Django function will generate random numbers and send them at an interval of 1 second to the javascript function  
3. The same javascript function will display that randomly generated number on the HTML page
